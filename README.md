Series of dCache Frontend Service Tests
=======================================

dCache Frontend Service is a Restful API for dCache. These series of tests can be only run after the system-test module have been successfully build and started.

This document contain instructions on the recommended installation procedure for software behind the test system and how to run the test(s).

## Robot Framework Installation Procedure

We are using [Robot Framework](http://robotframework.org/) for our test system. Robot Framework utilizes the keyword-driven testing automation approach. How to install Robot Framework is well documented [here](https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/blob/master/INSTALL.rst). However, below is the installation procedure I will recommend:

#### Pre-installation
Before installing robot framework, these following must be installed first:
1. Make sure you have python installed on your system. The latest release of Robot Framework, that is, version 3.0 will required at lease Python 2.7 and it also support Python >= 3.0. 
Before installing python, please check if it is alread pre-installed on your system. To check, typed this in your `terminal`:

>     python -V
If you have it installed, you see something like:
```
Python 2.7.10
```
So, if you don't have python on your system, go to https://www.python.org/ to download the right package and follow the installation instruction for your OS.

2. Next thing to do is to install `pip` (if you don't have it already). Installation instruction can be found [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/). _pip is a package management system used to install and manage software packages written in Python._

First check if pip is installed on system
>     pip -V

or

>     pip --version

If it is not install, on Linux or macOS run the following command
>     sudo easy_install pip

On Linux or macOS to update
>     pip install -U pip


#### Installation
To install Robot Framework using pip, execute the following command
>     pip install robotframework

Upgrading to the latest version is even very easy
>     pip install --upgrade robotframework

Uninstall
>     pip uninstall robotframework


Check if everything is fine before proceeding
>     robot --version

If robot is install, you should see something like:
```
Robot Framework 3.0 (Python 2.7.10 on linux2)
```

#### Post - Robot Framework Installation
The system-test test for the frontend is using an external library called robotframework-requests.
Hence one needs to install the library dependency before install the library itself.

Via pip, execute the following command one after the other
>     pip install -U requests
>     pip install -U robotframework-requests

## How to Run the test(s)

Once all the necessary dependencies had been installed, now you can run the test.
Change directory to where dcache source files.

###### For the whole frontend tests:

>     robot packages/system-test/target/bin/functional_test/frontend

###### For a particular test suite: 
Specify the path to the file (that is, the test-suite file):
>     robot  [path_to_the_test_suite_file]

Example
-------
Say the test-suite file path is `packages/system-test/target/bin/functional_test/frontend/authentication-test/invalid_login_attempt.robot`; hence simply run the command below to test it:
>     robot packages/system-test/target/bin/functional_test/frontend/authentication-test/invalid_login_attempt.robot

###### To test a particular test case in a test suite,
>     robot --test `[name_of_the_test_case]` `[path_to_the_test_suite_where_the_test_case_is]`

or

>     robot -t [name_of_the_test_case] [path_to_the_test_suite_where_the_test_case_is]

Example:
---------
To test a test case with 

    name: _Send A GET Requests Without Suppressing WWW-Authenticate_ 
    
and the test suite file path

    path: _packages/frontend/authentication-test/invalid_login_attempt.robot_ ; 
    
your robot command test will look like this:
>     robot --test 'Send A GET Requests Without Suppressing WWW-Authenticate' packages/system-test/target/bin/functional_test/frontend/authentication-test/invalid_login_attempt.robot

###### For a particular tag:
>     robot --include [space_seperated_tag_name/s]  [path_to_the_test]

By default, the system-test uses default credentials, that is, username and password. This might not work if it not setup properly. Therefore, to use a specific username and password, simply do this:

>     robot --variable username:[enter_username_here] --variable password:[enter_password_here] packages/system-test/target/bin/functional_test/frontend
